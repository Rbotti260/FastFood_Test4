This is a self-service kiosk designed for restaurant customers to place their own orders.  
When the customer presses the checkout button, the total price of the order including the sales tax will populate, prompting the user for payment.  
The software works by populating a selection of food items for the customer to choose.  The item and price are stored in array lists that are used to 
populate the receipt and total price of order.
